# NPM Quick Start Angular 2

**Angular 2 is still in beta!** This repository will be kept as in-sync with Angular 2 development as possible.

This repo is used to quick start development with Angular 2 using NPM and Typescript.

Clone the repo and type `npm i` to install the dependencies. Ignore any errors reported by npm whilst it's installing these dependencies because usually these errors are whilst trying to build native libs that fallback anyway.

When the install is complete, type `npm start` to compile the typescript, start a web server and open a browser window to point to the server.

Once `npm start` is running, you can go ahead and edit the files. When you save a file the compiler is re-run and the browser window is refreshed with the new code so you can see changes happening on the fly.
